# Express-Calculator

## Instructions
There are four operation values which a user may use:
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division

The route format to use is

`http://localhost:8080/:operator/:num1/:num2`

When that route is hit, your browser should display the result of the math operation and the two numbers on the screen.



For example, when the user goes to

`http://localhost:8080/addition/10/1`

the page should display 11.

## How to run this application
- `npm install`
- `node calculator.js` or `npm run start`
